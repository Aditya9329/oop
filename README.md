# What is class?
A C++ class combines data and methods for manipulating the data into one. Classes also determine the forms of objects. The data and methods contained in a class are known as class members. A class is a user-defined data type. To access the class members, we use an instance of the class. You can see a class as a blueprint for an object.

# Private and Public Keywords
You must have come across these two keywords. They are access modifiers.
### Private:
When the private keyword is used to define a function or class, it becomes private. Such are only accessible from within the class.

### Public:
The public keyword, on the other hand, makes data/functions public. These are accessible from outside the class.
